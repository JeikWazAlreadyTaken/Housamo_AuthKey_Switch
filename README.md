This is a simple app which lets you switch between your main and alternate Housamo accounts by cross-renaming your Main and Alt AuthKeys.
The app currently supports only two AuthKeys in total, I have no idea when or if I might add support for more but you are welcome to edit the code on your own.
If you do make a modification and want me to add it, feel free to make a pull request and I'll include anything that is an actual improvement to the app.
